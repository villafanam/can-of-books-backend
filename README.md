## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
+ Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
+ React
+ React bootstrap
+ MongoDB
+ Mongoose
+ VS Code
+ axios

  + Inform TM first, then get instructor involved if continues
+ What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  + Inform TM first, then get instructor involved if continues
+ How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  + Driver - Navigator method. Talk through issues.
